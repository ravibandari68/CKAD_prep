Multi-Container Pods are the pods which runs multiple containers that share the same network and storage volumes.

These are of 3 types:
a) Sidecar
b)Adapter
c) Ambassador

Sample YAML file of the multi-container pod: 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    - name: busybox-container
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo Sidecar running; sleep 10; done']

This pod runs:
nginx (main app)
busybox (sidecar for logging or helper tasks)

All the 3 types were defined as same in YAML file, the only difference is their functionality. 

| Pattern    | Role                                      | Example             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Sidecar    | Add functionality (e.g., logging, config) | Fluentd             |
| Ambassador | Proxy or connect to external service      | Envoy               |
| Adapter    | Format or transform app output            | Prometheus exporter |
